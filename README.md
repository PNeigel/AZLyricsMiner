# AZLyricsMiner
Python script that mines all lyrics from an entered artist

Example how this script creates files:

![Files](Example.png?raw=true "Example")
Files for single songs are optional, artist_all.txt (in this case "ED_SHEERAN_all.txt") will always be creted and has all words of every song in it.

Visualization of wordcount Ed Sheeran:
![Wordcount Ed Sheeran](Wordcount_ed_sheeran.png?raw=true "Wordcount Ed Sheeran")
